The concept of the "urban sociu-physical nexus" generates the underlying hypothesis indicating the feasibility of interpreting social data from aerial photographs. This position recognizes that urban social systems exist in a physical environment, and that they are characterized by material-cultural features which limit, condition and facilitate social interaction. The research problem involves empirical definitions of these multiple socio-physical relationships which may be used for predicting social structural information from the photo interpretation data. The accuracy of the photo interpretation information on several critical categories was evaluated in an experimental test, correlating photographic and ground observations of several urban residential areas. The photo interpretation data were sufficiently accurate for classifying the sub-areas according to physical structural attributes statistically associated with many sociological variables in A merican cities. A method of multi-variate analysis, the Guttman scalogram technique, was then applied to data for Birmingham, Alabama. This phase of the research which produced a mathematical model of the city considered as a comptex sociophysical system, provided supporting evidence of the utility of the aerial photographic method in urban social analysis.},

  abstract = {Many studies have assessed the process of forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon using remote sensing approaches to estimate the extent and impact by selective logging and forest fires on tropical rain forest. However, only a few have estimated the combined impacts of those anthropogenic activities. We conducted a detailed analysis of selective logging and forest fire impacts on natural forests in the southern Brazilian Amazon state of Mato Grosso, one of the key logging centers in the country. To achieve this goal a 13-year series of annual Landsat images (1992\textendash 2004) was used to test different remote sensing techniques for measuring the extent of selective logging and forest fires, and to estimate their impact and interaction with other land use types occurring in the study region. Forest canopy regeneration following these disturbances was also assessed. Field measurements and visual observations were conducted to validate remote sensing techniques. Our results indicated that the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index aerosol free (MSAVIaf) is a reliable estimator of fractional coverage under both clear sky and under smoky conditions in this study region. During the period of analysis, selective logging was responsible for disturbing the largest proportion (31\%) of natural forest in the study area, immediately followed by deforestation (29\%). Altogether, forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires affected approximately 40\% of the study site area. Once disturbed by selective logging activities, forests became more susceptible to fire in the study site. However, our results showed that fires may also occur in undisturbed forests. This indicates that there are further factors that may increase forest fire susceptibility in the study area. Those factors need to be better understood. Although selective logging affected the largest amount of natural forest in the study period, 35\% and 28\% of the observed losses of forest canopy cover were due to forest fire and selective logging combined and to forest fire only, respectively. Moreover, forest areas degraded by selective logging and forest fire is an addition to outright deforestation estimates and has yet to be accounted for by land use and land cover change assessments in tropical regions. Assuming that this observed trend of land use and land cover conversion continues, we predict that there will be no undisturbed forests remaining by 2011 in this study site. Finally, we estimated that 70\% of the total forest area disturbed by logging and fire had sufficiently recovered to become undetectable using satellite data in 2004.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the potential applications of satellite remote sensing to regional science research in urban settings. Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments.},

  abstract = {The majority of the world's population now resides in urban environments and information on the internal composition and dynamics of these environments is essential to enable preservation of certain standards of living. Remotely sensed data, especially the global coverage of moderate spatial resolution satellites such as Landsat, Indian Resource Satellite and Syst\`eme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT), offer a highly useful data source for mapping the composition of these cities and examining their changes over time. The utility and range of applications for remotely sensed data in urban environments could be improved with a more appropriate conceptual model relating urban environments to the sampling resolutions of imaging sensors and processing routines. Hence, the aim of this work was to take the Vegetation-Impervious surface-Soil (VIS) model of urban composition and match it with the most appropriate image processing methodology to deliver information on VIS composition for urban environments. Several approaches were evaluated for mapping the urban composition of Brisbane city (south-east Queensland, Australia) using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data and 1:5000 aerial photographs. The methods evaluated were: image classification; interpretation of aerial photographs; and constrained linear mixture analysis. Over 900 reference sample points on four transects were extracted from the aerial photographs and used as a basis to check output of the classification and mixture analysis. Distinctive zonations of VIS related to urban composition were found in the per-pixel classification and aggregated air-photo interpretation; however, significant spectral confusion also resulted between classes. In contrast, the VIS fraction images produced from the mixture analysis enabled distinctive densities of commercial, industrial and residential zones within the city to be clearly defined, based on their relative amount of vegetation cover. The soil fraction image served as an index for areas being (re)developed. The logical match of a low (L)-resolution, spectral mixture analysis approach with the moderate spatial resolution image data, ensured the processing model matched the spectrally heterogeneous nature of the urban environments at the scale of Landsat Thematic Mapper data.}

For this purpose field experiments were carried out at Bung Boraphet \textendash{} the largest fresh water lake in Central Thailand. Two clarity parameters, secchi disk transparency (SDT), at 80 locations for three events on April 15th 2008 and March 24th and 31st 2009, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) for the last two events were collected. These field data were collected nearly contemporaneous or contemporaneous to three Landsat 5 TM images, which were acquired on April 13th 2008 and March 24th and 31st 2009, respectively. Digital numbers of the Thematic Mapper (TM) image bands were transformed to at-sensor radiance by a radiometric correction process and then atmospheric correction was made using the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) code to acquire the surface reflectance. Linear regression equations between the log-transformed of clarity parameters and surface reflectance of each band and their band ratios at the same pixels were then determined. The band combinations TM1/TM3 and TM1 to estimate ln(SDT), and TM3/TM1 and TM1 to determine ln(SSC) for all satellite images were selected. These equations were later used to estimate the SDT and SSC values distributed across the whole lake. The results showed that lake wide average values of SDT for the three images are approximately 37, 97 and 81cm, respectively, while the values of SSC for the second and third images are around 11 and 13mg/l, respectively. The application of atmospheric correction to the TM data has proved to have the effect on the average values of SDT and SSC, and especially on their maximum and minimum values. Finally, it is possible to reduce the ground observation data of SDT and SSC substantially and still obtain reliable empirical relationships for the estimation of lake wide SDT and SSC values from TM data within the lake.},

It is essential to understand the impact of the land use land cover changes (LULC) on the regional climate variations over cities. This work mainly focuses on the changes in hotspot zones, UHIs during two different seasons - winter and summer. An attempt has been made to study the spatiotemporal variation in the urban heat islands (UHIs) and their relationship with LULC during 2000\textendash 2018, over Chandigarh (30\textdegree{} 43{${'}$} 59{${''}$} N, 76\textdegree{} 46{${'}$} 46{${''}$} E), a planned sub-tropical Indian city, using the remote sensing techniques. The indices such as Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), Dry Built-up Index (DBI) and Dry Bare-Soil Index (DBSI) are employed to differentiate the built-up areas (BA) from the drylands (DL) effectively. The changes observed in the LULC reveals an increase of 10\% in the BA at the expense of the vegetation during 2000\textendash 2018, which is in close agreement with the EBBI, DBI and DBSI assessments. A steady increase is observed in the UHI intensities for both summer and winter seasons during the study period. The UHIindex is noticed to be higher for the DL than that of the BA.},

  abstract = {``Urban Sprawl'' is a growing concern of citizens, environmental organizations, and governments. Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of ``Urban Sprawl'' range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The `scale-adjustment' mentioned in the title characterizes the ``Urban Sprawl'' of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the ``Sprawl Line'' determined by this regression. This ``Sprawl Line'' allows for a more fair comparison of ``Urban Sprawl'' between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more ``Urban Sprawl'' by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis\textendash St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas\textendash Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of ``Urban Sprawl'' by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to ``Urban Sprawl''. ``Urban Sprawl'' is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are `scale-adjusted'; also, the spatial patterns of ``Urban Sprawl'' shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of ``Urban Sprawl'' are changing.},

  abstract = {The acquirement of ground control points (GCPs) is a basic and important step in the geometric correction of remotely sensed imagery. In particular, the spatial distribution of GCPs may affect the accuracy and quality of image correction. In this paper, both a simulation experiment and actual-image analyses are carried out to investigate the effect of the sampling design for selecting GCPs on the geometric correction of remotely sensed imagery. Sampling designs compared are simple random sampling, spatial coverage sampling, and universal kriging model-based sampling. The experiments indicate that the sampling design of GCPs strongly affects the accuracy of the geometric correction. The universal kriging model-based sampling design considers the spatial autocovariance of regression residuals and yields the most accurate correction. This method is highly recommended as a new GCPs sampling design method for geometric correction of remotely sensed imagery.},

  abstract = {Earth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was officially launched by Google in 2005 as a ''geobrowser'', and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., ``land cover'', ``water'', ``model'', ``vegetation'', and ``forest''), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.},
