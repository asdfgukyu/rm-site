# Classification II

**Land cover classification, Continued**

Should we bother with creating new ones or use pre-classified data

- GlobeLand30
- ESA Climate Change Initiatiec annual global land cover
- Dynamic world --- neae real time classification of sentinel 2 10m
-Google building data
- MODIS -- quite coarse



Looking into dynamic world

- Semi-supervised approach: divide world into region, region into biomes

- Allows people to classify areas themselves, of min mapping unit of 50m2

  - Experts and non-experts

- Use surface reflectance to label, but uses Top of Atmosphere for modelling (bc they had a bigger data archive TOA at the time)


- Did some augmentation: rotated images

- Did Band ratioing --- NVDI

- Logtransformed from the raw reflectance values

- Used Convolution Neural Networks --- classified some data --- feed into machine --- output

- Criticism: images are **blobby** --- no clear definition

  - this is due to making users/definers use 5M2 pixels, meaning the whole areas got no texture

- Accuracy: Used confusion matrix

  - confusion matrix doesnt update as images updates

  - Radiant Machine Learning Hub --- trained data resource.

Evaluation: Its good for larges scale analysis.
