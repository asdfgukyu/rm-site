# Policy
This week focuses on how we may utilise insights gained from Earth Observation analysis to assist local, regional and national government to implement data-drive policies, whilst increasing compliance to urban/glolbal agendas.

## Case Study: Informal Settlements in Nairobi, Kenya
### Context

-   Until the Covid-19 pandemic, Nairobi was one of the fastest growing economies in Africa with annual average growth of 5.9% between 2010 - 2018 (@EconomicGrowthTrade2023a), GDP worth \$36 billion (@Nairobia)
-   2/3 of Kenyans continues to live in poverty, making less than £3.2 per day
-   70% Kenyan families are chronically vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity and preventable diseases.
-   75% of Nairobi is informal settlements, with predicted number of urban population living in slums to double in the next 15 years.
-   Informal settlements covers 5% of total residential land of the city. (UN Habitat, 2005)
-   This city is extremely vulnerable against impact of the climate crisis--haltering food security, reduce access to clean water, exposure to extreme heat.

### International Framework

**Sustainable Development Goals**

```

The Sustainable Development Goals is a set of 17 objectives that serves as a 'blueprint to a to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all', led by the United Nations. The SDGs pushes for sustainable development that recognises the interconnectedness of  social, economic and environmental aspect of society.

**UN SDG11**: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

**Target 11.1**: By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.

**UN SDG02**: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

**Target 02.1**: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.



### Urban-level framework

**Nairobi Climate Action Plan 2020-2050**

-   Until the Covid-19 pandemic, Nairobi was one of the fastest growing economies in Africa with annual average growth of 5.9% between 2010 - 2018 (USAid, nd), GDP worth \$36 billion (C40, nd)
-   2/3 of Kenyans continues to live in poverty, making less than £3.2 per day
-   70% Kenyan families are chronically vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity and preventable diseases.
-   75% of Nairobi is informal settlements, with predicted number of urban population living in slums to double in the next 15 years.
-   Informal settlements only cover 5% of total residential land of the city. (UN Habitat, 2005)
-   This city is extremely vulnerable against impact of the climate crisis--- haltering food security, reduce access to clean water, exposure to extreme heat.
-   Nairobi has set out 15 climate resilience action to strength the city against extreme weather, of which pertained very little detail onto how laid actions would be implemented.


### FOCUS Action 13: increase access to climate resilience programme.

```

-   Question on \*\*\*\*\*\*how\*\*\*\*\*\* the city of Nairobi aims to move towards such goals is unclear from this document.
-   The only mention of geospatial technology (GIS, satellite imagery) is briefly mentioned once, where the government acknowledge the lack of GIS technology to further enable an accessible and wide-spread urban transit system.
-   This shows the Nairobi government has a little idea onto how to harness Earth Observation data to push forward their urban climate agenda.
-   Build houses in climate sensitive areas?????
-   Slum mapping --- see where slums will expand and provide amenities accordingly.

## Application
### Slum identification

**Increase access to climate resilience programme** --- Identify arid land/flood zones, disaster mapping.

-   Slum identification --- see where slums will expand and provide amenities accordingly.
