## Summary

**Sustainable Development Goals** 

**UN SDG11**: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

**Target 11.1**: By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.


**Nairobi Climate Action Plan 2020-2050**

- Until the Covid-19 pandemic, Nairobi was one of the fastest growing economies in Africa with annual average growth of 5.9% between 2010 - 2018 (USAid, nd), GDP worth $36 billion (C40, nd)
- 2/3 of Kenyans continues to live in poverty, making less than £3.2 per day
- 70% Kenyan families are chronically vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity and preventable diseases.
- 75% of Nairobi is informal settlements, with predicted number of urban population living in slums to double in the next 15 years.
- Informal settlements only cover 5% of total residential land of the city. (UN Habitat, 2005)
- This city is extremely vulnerable against impact of the climate crisis— haltering food security, reduce access to clean water, exposure to extreme heat.
- Nairobi has set out 15 climate resilience action to strength the city against extreme weather, of which pertained very little detail onto how laid actions would be implemented.

### FOCUS Action 13: increase access to climate resilience programme.

```

- Question on ******how****** the city of Nairobi aims to move towards such goals is unclear from this document.
- The only mention of geospatial technology (GIS, satellite imagery) is briefly mentioned once, where the government acknowledge the lack of GIS technology to further enable an accessible and wide-spread urban transit system.
- This shows the Nairobi government has a little idea onto how to harness Earth Observation data to push forward their urban climate agenda.
- Build houses in climate sensitive areas?????
- Slum mapping — see where slums will expand and provide amenities accordingly.


## Application

**Increase access to climate resilience programme** — Identify arid land/flood zones, disaster mapping.

- Slum identification — see where slums will expand and provide amenities accordingly.
