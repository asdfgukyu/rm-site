# Policy
This week focuses on how we may utilise insights gained from Earth Observation analysis to assist local, regional and national government to implement data-drive policies, whilst increasing compliance to urban/global agendas.

## Case Study: Informal Settlements in Nairobi, Kenya
### Context

-   Until the Covid-19 pandemic, Nairobi was one of the fastest growing economies in Africa with annual average growth of 5.9% between 2010 - 2018 (@EconomicGrowthTrade2023a), GDP worth \$36 billion (@Nairobia). 
-  Despite  rapid growth, the city is unable to provide housing infrastructure for increasing population.
-   75% of urban population growth in Nairobi is absorbed by informal settlements, with predicted number of urban population living in slums to double in the next 15 years.
-   Informal settlements covers 5% of total residential land of the city, but inhabited by half of the city's population (@unhabitatKenyaNairobiUrban)
-   2/3 of Kenyans continues to live in poverty, making less than Â£3.2 per day
-   70% Kenyan families are chronically vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity and preventable diseases.
-   This city is also extremely vulnerable against impact of the climate crisis--haltering food security, reduce access to clean water, exposure to extreme heat.

### International Framework

**Sustainable Development Goals**

```

The Sustainable Development Goals is a set of 17 objectives that serves as a 'blueprint to a to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all', led by the United Nations. The SDGs pushes for sustainable development that recognises the interconnectedness of  social, economic and environmental aspect of society.

Relevant goals:

**UN SDG02**: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

- **Target 02.1**: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.

- **Indicator**: Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)


**UN SDG06**: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

- **Target 06.2**: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

- **Indicator**: Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water

**UN SDG11**: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

- **Target 11.1**: By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.

- **Indicator**: Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing


### Urban-level framework

**Nairobi Climate Action Plan 2020-2050**

-   Nairobi has set out 15 climate resilience actions to strength the city against extreme weather, of which pertained very little detail onto how laid actions would be implemented.

Relevant actions include:
#### Action 13: increase access to climate resilience programme.

```

-   How the city of Nairobi aims to move towards such goals is unclear from this document.
-   The only mention of geospatial technology (GIS, satellite imagery) is briefly mentioned once, where the government acknowledge the lack of GIS technology to further enable an accessible and wide-spread urban transit system.
-   This shows the Nairobi government has a little idea onto how to harness Earth Observation data to push forward their urban climate agenda.
-   The document also seems to encourage residential house buildings in climate sensitive areas.
-   Slum mapping --- see where slums will expand and provide amenities accordingly.

## Application
Informal settlements in Nairobi are recognised as a serious issues by the city level government, national government and referenced by the United Nations as a worsening problem.

Informal settlements need to be identified with regards to their direction of expansion and population variations within the settlements, such that sanitation infrastructure can be built in areas of high population density.

Areas of environmental vulnerability also needs to be identified.

### Slum identification

**Increase access to climate resilience programme** --- Identify arid land/flood zones, disaster mapping.

-   Slum identification --- see where slums will expand and provide amenities accordingly.
