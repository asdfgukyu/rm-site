The smaller the measure the more detailed the image will be.\n\nSomething like MODIS would have very high spatial data?\n\nSpectral: The number of bands from the electromagnetic spectrum it is surveying. Often earth surfaces require multispectral data for it to form a true colour image.\n\nie: green vegetation mainly requires red and near-infrared bands to detect, whereas soil requires mid-infrared bands (6 and 7) to be detected. Bodies of water can be detected mostly within visible light, RBGs.\nLandsat data surveys visible light, near infrared and short wave infrared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal: How frequently the data is collected. Often there is a direct trade off between pixel resolution and update frequency – higher the resolution, lower the update frequency. Good rm data is spenny!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the application of varying temporal and spatial resolution, and what it’s best for.\nRadiometric: Able to identify difference in light or reflectance of Earth surface.\n\nThe higher the bit, the higher the depth, the higher the ability to detect texture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlouresence Polarization Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Scattering Atmospheric\n** Go deeper on specific areas ** why things are useful, why you’d use this and not that in certain purposes."
