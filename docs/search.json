    "text": "Spatial: the size of the raster grid per pixel (cm/m). The smaller the measure the more detailed the image will be.\n\nSomething like MODIS would have very high spatial data?\n\nSpectral: The number of bands from the electromagnetic spectrum it is surveying. Often earth surfaces require multispectral data for it to form a true colour image.\n\nie: green vegetation mainly requires red and near-infrared bands to detect, whereas soil requires mid-infrared bands (6 and 7) to be detected. Bodies of water can be detected mostly within visible light, RBGs.\nLandsat data surveys visible light, near infrared and short wave infrared.\n\nTemporal: How frequently the data is collected. Often there is a direct trade off between pixel resolution and update frequency – higher the resolution, lower the update frequency. Good rm data is spenny!!\nRadiometric: Able to identify difference in light or reflectance of Earth surface.\n\nThe higher the bit, the higher the depth, the higher the ability to detect texture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlouresence Polarization Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Scattering Atmospheric\n** Go deeper on specific areas ** why things are useful, why you’d use this and not that in certain purposes."
