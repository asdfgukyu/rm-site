Hello! Welcome to my learning diary for CASA0023 Remote Sensing Cities and Environments at the Centre for Advance Spatial Analysis, UCL London.

I am a socio-cultural geographer, a producer in the culture sector and a spatial data scientist (!) . I got my undergraduate degree at the London School of Economics in Human Geography where I studied topics from urban planning, economic geography, and international development to investigating urban socio-spatial dynamics and role of the creative sector in urban space.

Swiftly after graduation I entered the cultural sector where I assist in theatre, dance, visual art and moving images programme curation and production in Hong Kong and London for three years.

Currently at CASA, I would like to further my geographic knowledge and gain technical skills and enter the field of urban sustainability. I am particularly interested in the topics of public housing, equity and climate resilience !

## Purpose

This learning diary is the assignment output of CASA00023 Remote Sensing Cities and Environment. The structure this book will be broken down by weeks, each with a different learning objective.

This book is created from R markdown and executable code.
