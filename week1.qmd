# Introduction

## Summary

### Lecture Overview: What is Remote Sensing?
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='40%'}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPuJYqY0=/?share_link_id=663563464417",
  ratio = "16:9")
```

### Resolutions of remote sensing images
**Spatial**: the size of the raster grid per pixel (cm/m). The smaller the measure the more detailed the image will be.

* Something like MODIS would have very high spatial data?

**Spectral**: The number of bands from the electromagnetic spectrum it is surveying. Often earth surfaces require multispectral data for it to form a true colour image. 

* ie: green vegetation mainly requires red and near-infrared bands to detect, whereas soil requires mid-infrared bands (6 and 7) to be detected. Bodies of water can be detected mostly within visible light, RBGs.
* Landsat data surveys visible light, near infrared and short wave infrared.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/spectral_signatures_landsat_450.jpeg")
```
**Temporal**: How frequently the data is collected. Often there is a direct trade off between pixel resolution and update frequency -- higher the resolution, lower the update frequency. Good rm data is spenny!!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/w1app.png")
```
This shows the application of varying temporal and spatial resolution, and what it's best for.


**Radiometric**: Able to identify difference in light or reflectance of Earth surface.

* The higher the bit, the higher the depth, the higher the ability to detect texture?

```

### Practical: Landsat, Sentinel, QGIS, SNAP
